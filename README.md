# Instabuy
http://instabuyapp.azurewebsites.net/

An eBay automated searcher client.

You can download and do whatever you want to this code.

I recommend reading the user manual guide (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cqLRKj8dAo0rlEQZwQkmbcjX-b-GG6wLVBg9O01RqhM/) before 
using the application. Due to me not wanting to spend any money on this, I am using the free Microsoft Azure servers which do not 
permit me to install any sort of SSL certificate so be wary of the lack of security this entails when accessing the website.

Due to the lack of an SSL certificate, some browsers may not allow push notifications which takes away a lot of functionality of Instabuy. 
At time of release, Microsoft Edge seems to work perfectly well.
